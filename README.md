# Image Processing
Repository for the examples discussed in the Image Processing practices. Folders here only contain the source codes and resources (images, videos). Explanations and figures are available on the course website. Examples are written in Python. Many libraries are used to extend the functionality of vanilla Python.

### The following libraries are used:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Keras (+ TensorFlow)

### Recommended folder structure:

Python files can be stored in folders grouped by the lecture topics, like in this repository. However, for beginners it is recommended to have all the example codes in the root of the project, with a single folder for all the resources.

```bash
improc-folder
├── resources-folder
│   ├── resource1.jpg
│   ├── resource2.png
│   └── ...
├── code1.py
├── code2.py
└── ...
```
