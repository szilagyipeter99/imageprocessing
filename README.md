# Image Processing
Repository for the examples discussed in the Image Processing practices. Folders here only contain the source codes and resources (images, videos). Explanations and figures are available on the course website. Multiple libraries are used to extend the functionality of vanilla Python, making it easier to perform calculations, import and manipulate images. Later in the semester the Keras library will help us build ML models.

This repository contains the examples discussed in the Image Processing practices. Each folder includes only the source code for these exercises. Explanations, figures, and theoretical background are available on the course website.

Throughout the examples, we use several Python libraries that extend the functionality of vanilla Python, simplifying calculations and enabling us to import and manipulate images effectively. Later in the semester, we’ll also use the Keras library to build machine learning models.

### The following libraries are used:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Keras (+ TensorFlow)

### Recommended folder structure:

Python files can be stored in folders grouped by the lecture topics, like in this repository. However, for beginners it is recommended to have all the example codes in the root of the project, with a single folder for all the resources.

```bash
improc-folder
├── resources-folder
│   ├── resource1.jpg
│   ├── resource2.png
│   └── ...
├── code1.py
├── code2.py
└── ...
```
